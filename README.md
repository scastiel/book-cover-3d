    height={200}
    pagesOffset={5}
  >
    <div />
  </BookCover>
)
```

## HTML and CSS for given settings

If you donâ€™t want to use the React component, you can extract the CSS generated for
given 3D settings.

```js
import { getCssForSettings } from 'book-cover-3d'

const settings = {
  rotate: 30,
  // ...
}
const css = getCssForSettings('BOOK_ID', settings)
```

```html
<div class="book-container-BOOK_ID">
  <div class="book">
    <img src="https://3dbook.xyz/demo-book.png" />
  </div>
</div>
```

Note that you can use a unique ID for your book cover (in HTML and when
calling `getCssForSettings`), so you can use different settings for
different books.
